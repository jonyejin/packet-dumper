# About Me ðŸŒŸ

Hi, Iâ€™m Yejin Cho, you can call me either Zoe or Yejin (pronounced as 'yae-jin')! 
Iâ€™m a network researcher, developer, and lifelong learner whoâ€™s passionate about exploring the **infrastructure that connects the world**. 

Currently Iâ€™m a master student of Computer Networks track at University of Southern California, Los Angeles.  
  
I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, South Korea. During my undergrad, I also used to work as iOS developer as well.  
  
Nowadays, as my interest moves towards research, I am studying Computer Networks (mostly Routing, Architecture, Virtualization and SD-WAN) from a Layer 3 and above perspective. I am also interested in using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze network topology, improve routing efficiency, and detect anomalies (while it hasn't been performing too good). I hope to contribute to the development of efficient, scalable, and equal networking.  
  
Currently I am looking/open for PhD opportunities in Computer Networks after my mastersðŸ™‚
